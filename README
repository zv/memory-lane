We created an augmented reality app which lets people share stories tied to locations
and experiences which happened on a day much like today.

In a world obsessed with the future and disconnected from the past, sometimes
our shared thread of experience with others is that they have walked in our footsteps, 
on a cloudy, muggy day like this.

We cross referenced GE CityIQ's environmental data with stories recorded under
similar conditions and notify the user when they've stumbled upon one.

There are thousands of digitized records of San Diego's past and present that
may be cross referenced with historical climate data from the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Agency, each telling stories of people like us, on a day
like this. 

From the hard-driving mayoral races of San Diego's unusually hot and wet 1880s,
to the poignant news stories recorded a 100 years later, of children gunned down
on street corners that are unmarked today

Each story has a location and radius from which you recieve notifications and
can listen to it, we've recorded a few stories for you to view here.
